The secondary aim to investigate why some people who carry the virus are symptomatic while others never are.

But there were serious problems in the early weeks of the scheme and the Department recognises that, even in the short time it had, it should have done more testing before the scheme went live. In those early weeks, Edenred’s systems failed to cope with the demand for vouchers and the volume of telephone calls and emails. Schools and parents found it difficult to access Edenred’s website and to get answers from Edenred to their queries. There were unacceptable delays in Edenred processing orders from schools and getting vouchers to families. Edenred took action to boost the capacity of its systems and we recognise that performance improved after April 2020. The Department and Edenred have now apologised to schools and families for the problems and inconvenience they encountered in the early stages of the scheme.",07 March 2021,CAPPED,DAILY,08 March 2021,18 March 2021

Since May 2020, the NHS Test and Trace Service (NHST&T) has led the national programme for testing and tracing in England, aiming to help break chains of transmission and enable people to return to a normal way of life. However, NHS T&T still has work to do to ensure it meets its critical targets and objectives in a timely and cost-efficient manner. We appreciate that NHST&T had to be set up and staffed at incredible speed, but in particular it now needs to wean itself off its persistent reliance on consultants and temporary staff. Up to November 2020, NHST&T had spent £5.7 billion, although it has been allocated far more (£37 billion over two years). The Department of Health & Social Care justified the scale of investment, in part, on the basis that an effective test and trace system would help avoid a second national lockdown; but since its creation we have had two more lockdowns. There is still no clear evidence to judge NHST&T’s overall effectiveness.

Over the last 14 months, family members—many of whom perform essential care giving roles—were either banned from visiting their loved ones or faced very significant limitations on their ability to be with them. The human cost of the visiting restrictions has been vast. Despite the efforts of the hard-working and dedicated people who work in social care, we heard numerous reports of people suffering rapid declines in their physical and mental health as they were isolated from their families for over a year. It has been a powerful reminder of why the right to family life is so important. Of course the Government has a duty to protect the lives of residents in care homes.

Thirdly, by later in October, we will have moved away from day 2 PCR testing to a new system of lateral flow tests for fully vaccinated passengers arriving from non-red list countries.

If effective, a contact tracing app could pave the way out of current lockdown restrictions, enabling individuals to move around more freely whilst helping to prevent the spread of the virus. However, any such app would have an impact on the right to private and family life, protected under Article 8 of the ECHR. If a contact tracing app enables people to move around freely and safely, and is accompanied with the sufficient protections, then the risk to privacy could be a more proportionate interference with individuals’ human rights than current restrictions imposed by the lockdown. However, there are significant concerns about a tracking app being rolled out at speed with the potential longer-term effects on personal freedoms and concerns around surveillance encroaching on people’s everyday lives. Such an app must not be rolled out nationally unless strong safeguards and protections are in place.

Understanding immunity to COVID-19, induced by both natural infection and through vaccination, is key to our ability to exit the current pandemic. In this report, you will find the answers to key questions around what we know and don’t know about immunity to the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, COVID-19. This includes the effectiveness of the immune response, how to measure and track immunity, the benefits of vaccine-mediated immunity, and the longevity of any immunity conferred.

We propose 12 criteria that should be satisfied by a COVID-19 vaccine passport, namely it should:
1. meet benchmarks for COVID-19 immunity;
2. accommodate differences between vaccines in their efficacy, and changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging SARS CoV-2 variants.
It should be:
3. internationally standardised with
4. verifiable credentials for
5. defined uses, and based on
6. a platform of interoperable technologies.
A passport should be:
7. secure for personal data,
8. portable and
9. affordable for individuals and governments.
It should meet:
10. legal and
11. ethical (equity and non-discrimination) standards, and,
12. the conditions of use should be understood and accepted by passport holders.
Current evidence and precedents suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine passport system is feasible, but that not all criteria have yet been satisfied and consideration should be given to what longer term precedents this may create.",12 April 2021,CAPPED,MONTHLY,13 April 2021,NULL

However, their use in relation to the coronavirus restrictions raises human rights concerns.
