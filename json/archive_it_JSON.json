Theaters were made to close down, cancelling ongoing performances and seasons without knowing if or when they would be back. In response, both professional and amateur theaters began various initiatives to bring theater to people at home while giving actors and other theater practitioners creative opportunities. Although theaters have reopened, COVID-19 had a massive impact financially, creatively, technologically, and existentially. This archive aims to capture some of that impact through news sources and blogs reporting on the shutdown and aggregating various virtual theatrical pursuits, from streaming already-filmed plays and musicals to performing live Shakespeare on Zoom. | The collection represents the captured websites as they existed in 2024, four years after the implementation of COVID quarantines. Because of this, many websites linked within the articles captured no longer exists or do not reflect the original link.

However, some sites, social media accounts and hashtags, have evolved into use beyond the pandemic. Some social media pages and hashtags have Kentucky-wide content. All other University of Kentucky web content, including all the UKnow press releases referring to the pandemic and the university and UK HealthCare social media accounts, can be found in the University of Kentucky Web Archives. Other community organizations and individuals' online resources that include coronavirus disease 2019 documentation but that are broader in scope than just that topic can be found in the Organizational Records and Community Personal Papers Web Archives collection. All records harvested through Archive-It and Webrecorder. Non-university seeds and social media pages are grouped under under Community or Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. Captured web pages and social media accounts can take a long time to load. Once a page is loaded, for access to embedded audio and video, users may have to click the play button in the Archive-It banner at the top of the page. The bulk of the seeds in this collection were captured from April 2020 to January 2023 and are no longer intentionally crawled. Many of these seeds may appear in other collections as long as the seed itself is still valid. Social media sites were not captured with consistent results, therefore some dates in Wayback may provide results while others may not.  Also, some seeds did not produce a capture because of technological challenges.  Those sites remain in the collection, but there is no associated content.","subject":[["Computers & Technology"],["College students--United States--Conduct of life"],["College students--United States--Diaries"],["Coronavirus infections -- Social aspects -- United States -- Kentucky"],["Coronavirus infections"],["Coronaviruses"]]},{"collection":" San Antonio Food and Drink Web Collection ","collected.by":" University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries Special Collections ","archived.since":"2010-05","description":"\nA collection of websites and social media pages maintained by San Antonio restaurants.

By ‘extreme right’ the Group understands a large ideological spectrum of radical right thinking, extending from anti-globalization and right-wing populism, to white nationalism, neo-fascism, and extremism. Extreme right movements and ideology share a number of features, which typically include hostility to globalization, fervent criticism of immigration, and have political, social, and religious aspects, and exist outside of and are more radical than mainstream conservatism. The Archive collects a wide array of web content, and aims to preserve this content for scholars, teachers, and future researchers in the humanities and social sciences as documentation of the rise of extreme right movements in Europe in the early twenty-first century. Most of the sites in this archive were added to the seed list in 2018 and it has not been significantly expanded since then. Much right-wing activity on the Internet has migrated from stable websites to social media platforms such as 8kun, Twitter, Telegram chats or Facebook--services that a web archive is not able for technical or legal reasons to capture comprehensively. This archive thus represents a snapshot in time, when the energy in European right-wing activity was rooted in anti-immigration, Islamophobia, long-standing issues exacerbated by the 2015 migration crisis. We have not systematically added any new sites reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine skepticism, QAnon, or the aftermath of the US 2020 election. The Archive is still actively crawling the sites listed. Although some users may find this content offensive or dangerous, its primary purpose is for research and teaching. Due to the nature of this material, access to the Archive is restricted to on-campus use within the Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation.
